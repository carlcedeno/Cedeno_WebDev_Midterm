<pr>I have friends, I have friends, <em> are they my friends ?</em> 
 <br>I mean do they treat our line that never ends? </br>
I have my main but the thing is , that main was not there main. </pr>
<br></br> 
<br></br>
<pr> Have you ever felt that you were doing some birthday surprise with them for her yet it felt like 
<br> that you were just an added coin? </br>
My point is, I was a loner. I’m sorry I couldn’t think of any connected word that rhymes with coin. 
<br>It felt like that <em>I’m just someone</em> that will be seen if I were in scene. </br>
All through out the year,<strong> keeping them intact was my only scheme.</strong> 
</pr> 
<br></br> 

<pr> Funny thing is that, I was immune and my heart grew on me. I don’t lean on them , and never again.
<br> I wouldn’t give my attachment for a close bargain because it would only be a heartbreak to be gained.</br>
Circle of friends will not always be an infinite circle, <strong>someone will have to leave to break the loop. </strong>
<br> You know, like a layer of an ice cream that will be scooped.</br> 
</pr>
<br></br>

<pr> I am not promoting loneliness because we, all do want company.
<br> Yet I am saying that it is okay to be alone as long as it is sunny. </br>
It is just that, people will leave and people will arrive and way go around.  
<br>Just grow your heart and mind, and infinite happiness with just this will be found. </br>
