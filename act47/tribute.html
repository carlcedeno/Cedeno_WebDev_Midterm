    <p style="color:red;font-size:40px;"> Biography </p>
<p>
Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg was born on October 24, 1989, in Gothenburg, Sweden. His mother and father, Johanna and Ulf, are both successful chief executives. As a child, he enjoyed art and playing on his Super Nintendo; his obsession with video games grew during adolescence, during which he spent a lot of time gaming in his bedroom, or at internet cafes. “Sweden has a great culture around gaming,” he told Rolling Stone magazine in 2015. “We’re really nerdy people.”</p>
<p>During his last year of high school, he bought a computer with money he made selling artwork through his grandmother’s gallery. He set up his first YouTube channel, PewDie, in 2006 — “pew” being slang for the sound of a laser gun firing — but as his interest in the channel waned, he forgot his password, so when he returned to YouTube in 2010, he was forced to set up a new account, PewDiePie.</p>
<> By now, Kjellberg had learnt to edit videos from an online tutorial, and uploaded his first "Let’s Play" video — of him playing Minecraft. He registered his PewDiePie account while at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, studying industrial economics and technology management. He struggled to fit in at Chalmers: “I had nothing in common with the rest of the people in the program,” he told Icon Magazine’s Maria Lindholm.</p>

<p>PewDiePie began to take off after Kjellberg filmed himself screaming his way around the horror game Amnesia, and began to receive requests from viewers for more of the same. He was soon uploading several clips a day, and eventually, to his parents’ horror, he dropped out of Chalmers in 2011 to work at a hotdog kiosk while he developed his channel. </p>
